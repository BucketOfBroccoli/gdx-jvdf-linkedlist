A parser for Valve Software's KeyValues ("VDF") format, commonly used by Source engine games, written entirely in Java. 

Forked from <a href="https://github.com/AreteS0ftware/jvdf-linkedlist">jvdf-linkedlist</a>, it adds functionality to support easier handling of various <a href="https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx">libGDX</a> objects, such as `Color`, `Vector3` & `Vector2`.
